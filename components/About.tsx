          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            Though I am most proficient in building full stack applications using Java, 
            JavaScript, HTML and CSS, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
            specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            Recently I have been focusing more on development of highly efficient applications with C++ and Rust.
            This helped me to deepen my knowledge of safe and performant software development
            and over all exites me for future advances in computer science and the industry.
